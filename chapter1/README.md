# Chapter 1 - Hello World program

It is considered to be a custom to start any programming course by creating a **Hello World** program. The oethr motive is to shine light into the structure of a **Go** program. The feeling of running the first Go program is truly rewarding abd this would act as a motivation to move forward.

This chapter has two prerequisites.

> 1.  Go shall be installed in your machine
>
> 2.  You are expected to have a Go programming editor

If the previous prerequisites are fulfilled, lets open the code editor and create a file named `main.go` with te following code.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello World")
}
```
