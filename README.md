# Learn Go Programming

The purpose of this repository is to teach the basics of go programming language. Go programming language is developed and actively supported by Google. This language has gained really good acceptance among developers in the past few years. The programming style is really easy for any new rogrammer to undertsand. Go provides unmatched performance in comparison with some of the popular languages out there. So, I strongly believe having go skills is certainly going to help any new developers in future.

The course is divided into multiple chapters. Some chapters may cover multiple topics.
